Building-Machine-Learning-Pipeline-on-Startups-Acquisition-Status
Our aim to understand the financial conditions of company fundraising goals.

Objective:
The objective of the project is to predict whether a startup which is currently Operating, IPO, Acquired, or closed.This problem will be solved through a Supervised Machine Learning approach by training a model based on the history of startups which were either acquired or closed.

Data:

Summary:
The data contains industry trends, investment insights and individual company information. Since the data was acquired on a trial basis, it only contains information about companies. After training the model, we predict whether startups still operating, IPO, acquired, or closed.

Data types:
There are many columns out of which will be used as features. The rest provide more information about the data, but will not be used for model training.

Data Cleaning:
In data cleaning we are will remove the inappropriate & unncessary information from raw data(main data).Hence, after which weâ€™ll perform data cleaning involving following steps:

Checking the percentage of NaN(null values) values present in each feature
Removing duplicates
Dropping columns which have NaN values.
Remove unnecessary and corrupted data.
Data Labelling.
